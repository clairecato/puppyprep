  <h3 class="homeh3">Raising a Puppy</h3>
    <p class="home-p">&emsp;&emsp; It is no secret that puppies are adorable, clumsy, curious rays of sunshine who will provide endless amounts of affection and entertainment to whomever is blessed by their presence. As puppies mature into adult dogs and find their place in their pack (but let's be honest, even adult dogs will always be "puppies"), they will prove that their loyalty and companionship have no limits. Animals that offer this much positivity to the world deserve to be raised thoughtfully and treated compassionately. They are, after all, a valued member of the family!<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The journey of raising a puppy will come with many moments of laughter and gratification as you take pride in your puppy's progress. It is natural to dream about all the fun you will have with your new best friend, but the decision to bring home a puppy should be taken very seriously. Patience, preparation, and consistency are absolutely essential to raising a happy and well-balanced puppy while holding on to your sanity.</p>

    <h3 class="homeh3">How to Prepare</h3>
    <p class="home-p">&emsp;&emsp;Whether you are in the process of deciding if you are ready to bring home a puppy, or you have just brought home a little furry angel and want to know what is in store for the next few months, preparation is key. Click through the pages in this website for information about what to expect during your first year with your new puppy. If you're here for cute puppy pictures, fear not! You can admire pictures and videos of my own puppy, Penny, as she stumbled through puppyhood on her oversized puppy paws.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;On the First Year page, you will find a timeline of milestones to look forward to, check off, and celebrate. The Budget Plan page contains a breakdown of the expenses that you can expect to have, so you can consider whether your family is able to commit to the financial investment of raising a dog. Finally, I offer my personal recommendations for some essential products in the Buying Guide page. Planning for your new puppy can be great fun, so I hope you will enjoy this stage of research and feel confident as you begin the journey of raising a puppy!</p>
