  <h2>What to expect with a new puppy</h2>
  <p class="intro">&emsp;&emsp;Watching your puppy mature into an adult dog can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but new dog owners may have a difficult time adjusting to the natural changes in temperament that happen as a dog goes through the stages of puppyhood. Knowing what to expect and when may go a long way towards easing the stress that comes with the responsibility of raising a healthy puppy.<br><br>

  &emsp;&emsp;Check out the timeline below for a few key milestones to keep an eye out for in your puppy's development. Importantly, know that every puppy will mature at a different rate. So if your puppy is taking longer than you expect to catch on to potty training, or if you are stressing about when your dog will learn how to walk on a leash, hopefully you can find peace in the fact that, with patience and a consistent training routine, all dogs really do figure it out. In my case, I was starting to accept the idea that the biting and nipping phase would be a permanent part of my life. But just as all the puppy books promised, one day I woke up and realized that the scratches had disappeared from my arms and ankles and the bite marks in the furniture had miraculously stopped multiplying. Keep moving forward and when you're frustrated, remind yourself that the struggles of the puppy phase do not last forever.<br><br>

  &emsp;&emsp;Enjoy celebrating these year 1 milestones as they come. Take lots of pictures and videos. Once your pup is all grown up, you will look back on this time fondly. Puppies grow up so fast!</p>

          <h3>8 weeks: Bring your puppy home!</h3>
          <p class="details">Puppies must stay with their mom for the first eight weeks. Once they come to their new home, they may be nervous at first. They will need lots of reassurance for the first few weeks to gain confidence!</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="content right">
          <h3>8-12 weeks: Start training</h3>
          <p class="details">Puppies are the most impressionable from about 8-12 weeks. That means their behavior can most easily be molded during this time, so start training and forming good habits early. Work with your puppy on basic commands early and often with lots of positive reinforcement, and you will be amazed how fast they can learn!</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="content left">
          <h3>8-11 weeks: Fear-impact period</h3>
          <p class="details">Because they are so impressionable, negative or frightening experiences will be internalized and may resurface as triggers later in life. Take extra care to ensure your puppy is closely supervised and protected from traumatic experiences during this time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="content right">
          <h3>12-30 weeks: Teething</h3>
          <p class="details">Adult teeth start to come in between 3-6 months. With teething comes the dreaded chewing and nipping phase, as your puppy searches for ways to relieve the pain. Provide lots of toys for your puppy to chew on to distract them from your fingers and furniture. Small ice cubes or even a frozen wet rag can soothe their pain.<br><br><em>Pro tip - restrict your puppy from rooms with valuable furniture pieces for the first year. They almost certainly will not survive unscathed!</em></p>

          <h3>4-8 months: Adolescence</h3>
          <p class="details">There will come a time when your sweet and innocent snuggle buddy transforms (temporarily) into a devilish rascal. At around 4 months, they feel comfortable in their new home and are confident enough to start testing boundaries. They become a lot more coordinated and have tons of energy to burn. Be very consistent with your training during this time and don't let their lapse in progress discourage you. Make sure your puppy knows that you set the rules, not him! A timeout or routine nap in the crate may be warranted to keep their curiosity from transforming into destructive behaviors. </p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="content right">
          <h3>12 months: Technically an adult, but forever a puppy at heart!</h3>
          <p class="details">Depending on the breed, most small dogs are physically matured into adults around 1 year, while larger breed  dogs may take closer to 2 years. In both cases, dogs still have lots of emotional and mental maturation to achieve, and they certainly still have lots of energy to spend on exploring new things! Luckily for you, most dogs will hold on to those lovable, silly puppy traits for as long as you can embark on new adventures with them.</p>
